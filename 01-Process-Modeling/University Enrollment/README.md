## Process Name
University of Nanaimo – Student Enrollment Process

## Objective
To analyze and model the end-to-end student enrollment process at the University of Nanaimo, from initial application submission to
final enrollment confirmation.

## Process Overview
This repository contains a conceptual BPMN process model that documents the complete student application and enrollment journey.
The process spans multiple university departments and includes parallel reviews, system interactions, exception handling, and
financial validation.
